# Fork notes

Ted's Terminal is a nice base for a "Terminal-View" in WPF. This fork aims to deconstruct it into one or more WPF controls instead of a standalone tool. If you look for the standalone version go to the origin repo of this fork. 

All credits go to Ted, I'm just deleting stuff.

Original readme follows.
